# Style-Transfer
Simple Style Transfer with VGG16 (used pretrained-model downloader from [here](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials)).
Download and run Style Transfer.ipynb to get started.
The style and content images can be changed to whatever images you want but should be about 200 by 200 pixels in size (any resolution works however).
